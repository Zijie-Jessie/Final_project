# Final_project
Project Description:
In March 2022, Uber announced a groundbreaking decision to allow its New York City-based users to hire yellow taxis directly from its app. This project aims to explore the impact of this collaboration by analyzing trends and behaviors in hired-ride trips across New York City from January 2020 through August 2024, combined with analyzing some weather impacts with a dataset from 2020 to 2024.
